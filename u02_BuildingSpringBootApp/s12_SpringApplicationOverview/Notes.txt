- **Overview of the Web Application**:
  - We will build a simple web-based application using Spring Boot.
  - The web browser will interact with the Spring Boot app, which listens on port 8080 by default. This is a common convention for Java application servers.
  - Spring Boot uses an embedded Tomcat server, which will route HTTP requests to the Spring Boot application and handle responses with HTML.

- **Runtime Environment**:
  - The Spring Boot application runs within the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).
  - Tomcat is embedded within the Spring Boot application, and it starts up as part of the runtime environment.
  - The request lifecycle:
    - Requests from the browser reach the embedded Tomcat server.
    - Tomcat routes the requests to Spring MVC controllers.
    - Controllers handle requests and pass them to service layers.
    - Service layers may interact with the database using Spring Data JPA.

- **Spring Data JPA and Database Operations**:
  - The application will use Spring Data JPA for database operations, with an in-memory H2 database as the data source.
  - We only need to write repository interfaces, as Spring Data JPA automatically generates the implementation.
  - Hibernate, a JPA implementation, will handle the SQL generation and communication with the database using JDBC.

- **Request Handling and Response Generation**:
  - Data retrieval:
    - The controller receives the request and passes it to the service layer.
    - The service layer interacts with the repository to fetch data.
    - Data flows back up through the repository, service, and controller layers.
  - Thymeleaf:
    - The Thymeleaf engine generates the HTML response using the data from the controller.
    - The browser receives and renders this HTML response.

- **Project Structure and Design Pattern**:
  - The application will follow a common design pattern with packages for controllers, services, repositories, and domain:
    - **Controllers**: Handle HTTP requests using Spring MVC.
    - **Services**: Custom services to handle business logic. Typically, services implement interfaces to facilitate dependency injection and support multiple implementations.
    - **Repositories**: Interfaces for database operations, with implementations provided by Spring Data JPA.
    - **Domain**: Plain Old Java Objects (POJOs) representing the data model, configured as JPA entities.

- **Development Plan**:
  - Start by creating and mapping domain objects.
  - Gradually build the rest of the application, including controllers, services, and repository interfaces.
  - By the end of the section, we will have a functional web application capable of persisting and retrieving data from the H2 in-memory database.
